              How the EC Dollar Works
              <span class="accordion__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion__body">
              <p>The Eastern Caribbean Dollar (EC$) is the official currency of Saint Lucia and seven other Eastern Caribbean island nations. It has been pegged to the US dollar at EC$2.70 = US$1.00 since 1976 — this rate never changes. This makes mental conversion simple: divide EC$ prices by 2.7 to get US$.</p>
              <p>Quick examples:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>EC$27 = US$10</li>
                <li>EC$54 = US$20</li>
                <li>EC$135 = US$50</li>
                <li>EC$270 = US$100</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When you see prices in both currencies, always check whether the exchange rate being applied is 2.70 or a slightly worse rate (2.60–2.65) as some vendors quote informally. The official rate is always 2.70.</p>

              US Dollars — Where Accepted
              <span class="accordion__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion__body">
              <p>US dollars are widely accepted at hotels, resorts, restaurants, tour operators, and most tourist-facing businesses throughout Saint Lucia. Many prices in tourist areas are quoted in US dollars.</p>
              <p>However, local markets, small shops, minibuses, street food vendors, and village businesses typically prefer EC$. If you pay in USD at a local business, you may receive change in EC$ — which is fine, but check the rate being applied.</p>
              <p><strong>Best approach:</strong> Have some EC$ for everyday local spending (food markets, minibuses, tips, small purchases) and keep USD or a card for bigger purchases at hotels and tour operators.</p>

              Credit Cards — Where They Work
              <span class="accordion__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion__body">
              <p>Visa and Mastercard are accepted at most hotels, restaurants, car rental companies, and larger tour operators. American Express acceptance is less reliable. Contactless payment is increasingly available at modern establishments.</p>
              <p><strong>Where cards don't work:</strong> Local markets, minibuses, small street vendors, many tour guides and gig economy operators, and some small guesthouses operate cash-only. Always have EC$ or USD cash available for these situations.</p>
              <p><strong>ATM advice:</strong> ATMs are available in Castries (Bank of Saint Lucia, First National Bank of St Lucia, RBC Royal Bank), Rodney Bay (near the marina), Vieux Fort, and Gros Islet. They dispense EC$. Notify your bank before travelling to avoid your card being blocked for overseas transactions. ATM fees can be significant — try to withdraw larger amounts less frequently.</p>

              <p class="tip-box__title">Practical Tip — Currency Exchange</p>
              <p>The best exchange rates are at banks and official exchange bureaux in Castries. Airport exchange kiosks offer worse rates. Hotels typically offer the worst exchange rates of all. If you're changing money, do it at a bank in town. For most visitors, simply withdrawing EC$ from an ATM on arrival is the most convenient and competitive option.</p>

              <p>Saint Lucia uses UK-style three-pin plugs (Type G) at 220 volts, 50Hz. If you're travelling from North America (where the standard is 110V / 60Hz with two flat pins), you need both a plug adaptor AND a voltage converter for devices that are not dual-voltage. If you're from continental Europe (two round pins, 220V), you need a plug adaptor but should be fine on voltage. UK visitors need nothing at all.</p>

              What Is Dual Voltage? — Check Your Devices
              <span class="accordion__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion__body">
              <p>Most modern electronics are dual-voltage — they can handle both 110V and 220V automatically. Look for the label on the device itself (or its charging brick): it will say "Input: 100–240V" if it's dual-voltage. This includes most laptop chargers, phone chargers, camera chargers, and USB adaptors.</p>
              <p>Devices that are NOT dual-voltage and WILL be damaged at 220V without a converter: older hair dryers, some curling irons/straighteners, some travel appliances. Check before you go.</p>
              <p>The simplest solution: buy a universal travel adaptor with USB ports. It handles the plug shape issue and lets you charge USB devices without worrying about voltage (the USB converters inside are dual-voltage). For high-wattage devices (hair dryers), buy a 220V travel hair dryer rather than packing a converter — they're cheaper and lighter.</p>

            <div class="accordion__body">
              <p>Most hotels catering to North American guests have a mix of socket types — some rooms include US-style sockets (110V) in addition to UK-style ones. High-end all-inclusive resorts often have universal socket adaptors in rooms or at the front desk on loan. If in doubt, call ahead and ask.</p>
              <p>Boutique guesthouses and smaller properties may have strictly UK-type sockets throughout. Don't assume and be left without a charge for your phone on the first night — pack an adaptor regardless.</p>

          <h2>Language</h2>
          <p class="section__lead">English is the official language and there's no language barrier for English-speaking visitors. But understanding Kwéyòl opens a window into the real Saint Lucia.</p>

          <p>Saint Lucia's official language is <strong>English</strong>, spoken in education, government, media, and business. All signage is in English. You will not struggle to communicate anywhere on the island as an English speaker.</p>

          <p><strong>Kwéyòl</strong> (also spelled Creole or Patois) is a French-based Creole language spoken widely in informal settings — at home, in markets, between friends, and in rural communities. It evolved among enslaved Africans in the French Caribbean, blending African grammatical structures with French vocabulary. A significant number of older Saint Lucians speak Kwéyòl as their primary language at home, though nearly everyone also speaks English.</p>

              Useful Kwéyòl Phrases
              <span class="accordion__icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion__body">
              <p>A few phrases go a very long way in showing respect for local culture:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Bonjou</strong> — Good morning (pronounced "bon-zhoo")</li>
                <li><strong>Bonswa</strong> — Good afternoon / Good evening</li>
                <li><strong>Oui / Non</strong> — Yes / No</li>
                <li><strong>Mèsi</strong> — Thank you</li>
                <li><strong>Sa ka fèt?</strong> — What's happening? / How are you?</li>
                <li><strong>Tout bagay ka maché</strong> — Everything is fine (literally "everything is walking")</li>
                <li><strong>Kouman w rélé?</strong> — What is your name?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Saint Lucians absolutely appreciate when visitors make the effort to use even a word or two of Kwéyòl. It immediately marks you as someone interested in more than just the beach, and often opens up much warmer and more genuine conversations.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p><strong>Saint Lucian English accent:</strong> The English spoken in Saint Lucia has a distinctive Caribbean musicality that some visitors initially find takes a moment to tune into. The rhythm and intonation are different from North American or British English. Within a day or two, your ear adjusts completely and you'll find it entirely clear — and probably the most pleasant English accent you've ever heard.</p>

          <p>Because Saint Lucia does not observe daylight saving time, the offset from North America changes by one hour depending on the time of year. This can occasionally catch travellers out when calling home — double-check time differences around the US/Canada DST changeover dates in March and November.</p>

              <p>Working in Saint Lucia on a tourist visa is not permitted. If you intend to work, you need a work permit, which must be applied for by your employer or sponsor before you arrive. Remote work on a tourist visa exists in a legal grey area — there is no specific digital nomad visa as of 2026, though this is an area several Caribbean nations are actively developing.</p>

          <h2>Safety</h2>
          <p class="section__lead">Saint Lucia is a generally safe Caribbean destination. Understanding the real picture — not the overstated warnings, not the naively optimistic view — helps you travel confidently.</p>

          <p>The honest assessment: Saint Lucia is safe for tourists exercising ordinary common sense. The vast majority of visitors have entirely incident-free trips. Tourist areas — Rodney Bay, Castries waterfront, Pigeon Island, Marigot Bay, Soufriere — are well-visited and generally safe during daylight hours and in the early evening.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion__body">
              <p>Some areas of Castries (particularly inland residential areas away from the tourist waterfront) experience higher rates of petty crime. Avoid walking through unfamiliar areas of Castries at night. The Derek Walcott Square area and main commercial streets are generally fine during the day.</p>
              <p>Some beach areas at night are not well-lit and are best avoided. Stick to the well-trafficked beach strips (Reduit Beach in Rodney Bay) in the evenings. Remote beaches are beautiful during the day — avoid them after dark.</p>
              <p>Vieux Fort has a reputation for being rougher than the north of the island. If visiting for Anse de Sables beach (worth it for wind sports), go during the day and be more vigilant with belongings than you might be in Rodney Bay.</p>

              <p>The main safety concern for tourists in Saint Lucia is opportunistic petty theft — left-unattended belongings on beaches, phones left on restaurant tables, bags in rental cars. These are easily preventable with simple habits:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Never leave valuables on the beach unattended, even briefly</li>
                <li>Don't leave bags or phones visible in parked rental cars</li>
                <li>Use your hotel safe for passport, extra cash, and valuables</li>
                <li>Be aware of your surroundings in busy markets and on minibuses</li>

              <p><strong>Ocean safety:</strong> The Atlantic side of the island has strong currents and is unsuitable for casual swimming. The west (Caribbean) coast is calmer. Heed beach flags. Never swim alone in remote areas.</p>
              <p><strong>Road safety:</strong> Saint Lucia drives on the left. Roads in tourist areas are generally good; secondary roads can be narrow, winding, and poorly maintained. Mountain roads around Soufriere are particularly challenging — take them slowly. Minibus drivers are often... enthusiastic. Road accidents are the single biggest cause of tourist injury in Saint Lucia, so drive carefully and always wear a seatbelt.</p>
              <p><strong>Hiking:</strong> Don't hike without a guide. Don't hike alone. Tell your hotel where you're going and when you expect to return. Have water, sun protection, and a phone (offline maps downloaded).</p>

              <p>Dengue fever is present in Saint Lucia and the wider Caribbean. It's transmitted by mosquitoes that bite during the day (Aedes aegypti), so sunscreen and bug spray should be applied simultaneously during outdoor activities. Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, and rash. If you develop these symptoms within 2 weeks of returning home, tell your doctor you visited the Caribbean.</p>
              <p>Zika virus is present but at low transmission levels. Pregnant women or those planning pregnancy should consult their doctor before travelling. Malaria is not present in Saint Lucia.</p>
              <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use DEET or picaridin-based insect repellent. Wear long sleeves and trousers at dawn and dusk. Use mosquito nets if your accommodation doesn't have screened windows.</p>

              <p><strong>The downsides:</strong> Accommodation prices are 30–50% higher than low season. Popular resorts sell out months ahead. Beaches are busier. Some tours and activities book out.

              <p><strong>The real picture:</strong> The majority of days even in the low season are sunny and warm (28–32°C / 82–90°F). Rainfall typically comes in short, intense bursts — often in the afternoon — rather than all-day grey weather. The island turns an extraordinary shade of green. You'll often have beaches almost to yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>Savings:</strong> Hotel prices drop 30–50%. All-inclusive packages offer genuine value. Flights are cheaper. Activities are less crowded.</p>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget-conscious travellers, repeat visitors, nature lovers, those who prefer a quieter, more authentic experience, and festival-goers (Jazz in May, Carnival in June–July).</p>

                <li><strong>Reef-safe sunscreen (SPF 50+)</strong> — important for both your skin and the reefs. Bring enough from home; reef-safe options are available locally but limited in selection and more expensive.</li>
                <li><strong>Insect repellent</strong> — DEET or picaridin-based. Available locally but bring some to have immediately on arrival.</li>
                <li><strong>After-sun lotion</strong> — you will underestimate the sun on your first day. Have it ready.</li>
                <li><strong>Prescription medications</strong> — bring your full supply plus a few extra days, in original packaging with a copy of your prescription.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic first aid kit</strong> — plasters, antiseptic, motion sickness tablets (roads and boat trips warrant it), rehydration salts.</li>
                <li><strong>Hand sanitiser</strong> — for street food situations and when handwashing isn't available.</li>

                <li><strong>Unlocked phone</strong> — to use with a local SIM card (check your phone is unlocked before you travel)</li>
                <li><strong>Offline maps downloaded</strong> — Google Maps or Maps.me with Saint Lucia downloaded for offline use. Mobile coverage can be patchy in rural areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera with dry bag</strong> — the scenery demands it. Keep electronics dry.</li>

                <li><strong>Formal business attire</strong> — unless you're genuinely attending business meetings. Smart-casual covers all scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Your own snorkel gear</strong> — rental is available cheaply at all major snorkel beaches. Only bring your own if you specifically prefer your mask fit.</li>
                <li><strong>Hair dryer (non-dual voltage)</strong> — it will be fried at 220V. Buy a 220V travel dryer or use what your hotel provides.</li>
